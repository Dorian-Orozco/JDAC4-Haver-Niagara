Database Creation TO DO:
- Verify Fk /Pk Relationship between Models / missing (or extra?) Fk's in Data Table
- figure out image/url support for Media entity (or leave for later and focus on getting DB up)
- Create DBContext and establish one to many one to one relationships there
- Execute Migration commands in NuGet Packet Manager and create actual SQL DB
